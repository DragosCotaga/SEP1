        <h3> Latest Covid-19 information</h3>
        <p> At The Outlook Hotel, we strive to provide no less than extraordinary guest experiences. The wellbeing of our guests, visitors, and the team is our main priority, so you can feel safe from check-in to check-out, and everywhere in between. Here’s what we do based on guidelines from our local health authorities.</p>
        <p> SOCIAL DISTANCING – We make sure to keep a safe distance between guests and the team.</p>
        <p> THE TEAM – is all trained in hygiene protocols that prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and make you feel safe. They wash and sanitize hands after every encounter. Hands are dried with paper, not towels. Every colleague is required to stay home if feeling unwell.</p>
        <p> CLEAN SURFACES - We clean and disinfect surfaces frequently throughout the day with special attention to high-touch areas. We are using high-level hygiene products, that still live up to the environmental requirements and our sustainable code of conduct.</p>
        <p>THE ROOMS – We use disinfectant detergents and make sure to pay extra attention to high-touch items</p>

        <h3> Organic breakfast now at our hotel!</h3>
        <p>A good day doesn't have to start with our Good Morning. It's Organic! breakfast - but it usually does.

You will always find freshly baked bread, breakfast cereal, seasonal fruits, delicious juices, smoothies and much more. We could go on and on, but you'd do better trying it for yourself.</p>
        <p> OPENING HOURS </p>
        <p>Weekdays: 7:00 - 10:00 /  Weekends & Holidays: 7:30 - 11:00</p>

    <p>"Super helpful, easy-going staff at the reception. Stylish room with good amenities, even an iron, kettle and coffee machine. Comfy bed."</p>
    <p> "Excellent hotel. All areas of hotel (bedrooms,bathrooms,dining area and foyer) are spotlessly clean. Staff extremely helpful. Really good buffet breakfast plenty of choice. Also found the secure parking a bonus as we had a very full car, having just come from the ferry. Would definitely stay at this hotel again."</p>
